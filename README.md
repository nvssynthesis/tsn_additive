TSN Additive:
an additive synthesizer using the Timbre Space Navigation (TSN) concept.
This allows for resynthesis of an analyzed sound ordered in terms of timbral features, rather than time.
That is, rather than stepping through the analysis of a sound from the start frame to the end frame and resynthesizing, navigation can be accomplished based on timbral similarity between frames.
TSN Additive uses a graph structure built from the analysis file to accomplish this.
